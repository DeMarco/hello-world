# hello-world
This is me learning how to use GitHub.

I find moon colony concepts quite sexy, especially the ones that involve domming over craters, although a zepelin like baloon over Venus' atmosphere is also quite appealing.
Can't wait to move in to my own new spacious appartment somewhere else in the Solar System, with my autonomous self-sustainable indoor hydroponics facility and fusion reactor, where I can finish my own version of Iron Man's suit without being disturbed by the need of earning a salary and walking to the closest grocery store to get some decent, not-so-intoxicating food.
